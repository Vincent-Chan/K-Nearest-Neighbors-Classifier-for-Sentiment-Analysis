# K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier for Sentiment Analysis

This is actually a pragramming assignment from COMP2211 in HKUST. This assignment uses K-nearest neighbors classifier to perform sentiment analysis. This assignment is special as it is programmed from scratch rather than using the existing libraries and APIs from some popular libraries and packages such as scikit-learn.

You can see my code in pa1_sentiment_analysis_knn.ipynb

The official solution is in pa1_solution.py
